WiredTiger release 11.0.1, 2022-XX-XX
------------------------------------

The WiredTiger 11.0 release is a complete refresh of the WiredTiger storage engine.
Applications written to earlier versions of the WiredTiger API will require review
(although the API structure is substantially the same as previous releases). Applications
using row-store data objects can use those objects without change. Applications using
fixed- or variable-length column-store data objects will require a dump and reload cycle
to import those objects into a 11.0 release environment.
