# WiredTiger's Azure Extension
## 1. Introduction
This extension allows WiredTiger storage source extensions to read from and write to objects stored in Azure Blob Storage using WiredTigerâ€™s provided internal abstraction for storing data in an object storage service.

## 2. Building and running
This section describes how to build WiredTiger with the Azure extension enabled.

### Requirements
<li> CMake 3.13 or higher <p>

Check your CMake version by typing `cmake --version`.

### How to install requirements (skip this step if requirements have been met)

If the CMake version is not 3.13 or higher update your CMake to 3.13 using the following.
```bash
wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.13/cmake-3.13.0.tar.gz
tar xf cmake-3.13.0.tar.gz

cd cmake-3.13.0

./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Check that your CMake has been updated using the following command `cmake --version`.

### Building

There is current only 1 way to build WiredTiger with Azure extension:
1. Letting CMake manage the Azure SDK dependency as an external project, letting it download, link and build the extension.

There are two CMake flags associated with the Azure extension: `ENABLE_AZURE` and `IMPORT_AZURE_SDK`.
* `ENABLE_AZURE=1` is required to build the Azure extension.
* `IMPORT_AZURE_SDK={external}` is used to set the build method.
    *   `external` tells the compiler to search for an existing system installation of the SDK.
    *    This flag should be set alongside the `ENABLE_AZURE` flag.
    *    If the `IMPORT_AZURE_SDK` flag is not specified, the compiler will assume a system installation of the SDK which will be implemented at a later stage.

### Letting CMake manage the SDK dependency as an external project

This method configures CMake to download, compile, and install the Azure SDK while building the Azure extension.

```bash
# Create a new directory to run your build from
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and run cmake with Ninja
cmake -DENABLE_PYTHON=1 -DHAVE_UNITTEST=1 -DIMPORT_AZURE_SDK=external -DENABLE_AZURE=1 -G Ninja ../.
ninja
```

* The compiler flag `IMPORT_AZURE_SDK` must be set to `external` for this build method.
* `ENABLE_AZURE` defaults to looking for a local version, the `IMPORT_AZURE_SDK` setting will override that default.
## 3. Development
In order to run this extension after building, the developer must have an Azure connection string locally to a container with the right permissions. The connection string must be stored in an environmental variable called `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`. To store your connection string into an environmental variable type `export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="your Azure connection string"` into your terminal.
## 4. Testing

### To run the tiered python tests for Azure:

```bash
# This will run all the tests on the Azure storage source. The following command will run the tests from the build directory that was built earlier.
cd build
env WT_BUILDDIR=$(pwd) python3 ../test/suite/run.py -j 10 -v 4 test_tiered19
```

### To run the C unit tests for Azure:

```bash
# Once WiredTiger has been built with the Azure Extension, run the tests from the build directory
cd build
ext/storage_sources/azure_store/test/run_azure_unit_tests
```

To add any additional unit testing, add to the file `test_azure_connection.cpp`, alternatively if you
wish to add a new test file, add it to the `SOURCES` list in `create_test_executable()`
(in `azure_store/test/CMakeLists.txt`).

## 5. Evergreen Testing
Currently the Evergreen testing runs both `test_tiered19.py` and the unit tests in `test_azure_connection.cpp`. Should a developer wish to additional tests to the extension, they would first have to write the tests before adding it as a task to the evergreen.yml file.

When creating a new task, a developer should note that the CMake binary should be set to the MongoDB V4 toolchain due to the CMake 3.13 minimum requirement.
