# FIXME-WT-12512 TSan is raising warnings about mutexes that are non-intuitive. These will be investigated separately.

# FIXME-WT-12514 Some of our shared variables are floats or doubles which can't be accessed using atomic instrinsics.

# FIXME-WT-12610 Fields like log->slot_state are composite variables and more complex than the usual storing 
# and loading of ints. These fields will be investigated in a separate ticket. 
race:src/log

# FIXME-WT-12611 CONNECTION_API_CALL contains a data race that touches the session array, but the number of macro 
# calls makes diagnosing this very hard. For now suppress the surrounding function and handle this in a separate ticket.

# __tiered_queue_peek_empty is intentionally unsafe to avoid taking the tiered lock when it's not needed.
