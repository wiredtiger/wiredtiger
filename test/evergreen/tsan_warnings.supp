# CONNECTION_API_CALL contains a data race, it allows concurrent access to the default session. This
# means that APIs that call that macro, e.g. __conn_open_session will trip TSan. If other connection
# API calls trip TSan for the same reason then add them here. Though it unusual for connection APIs
# to be called concurrently.

# __wt_configure_method intentionally allows for races between threads to avoid the overhead of taking a lock on each API call.
