CHANGES
-------

* New function ``per_module_scenarios`` for tests that should be applied across 
  multiple modules providing the same interface, some of which may not be 
  available at run time.  (Martin Pool)

* ``TestWithScenarios`` is now backed by a mixin - WithScenarios - which can be
  mixed into different unittest implementations more cleanly (e.g. unittest2).

CHANGES
-------

* Created project. The primary interfaces are
  ``testscenarios.TestWithScenarios`` and
  ``testscenarios.generate_scenarios``. Documentation is primarily in README. 
  (Robert Collins)

* Make the README documentation doctest compatible, to be sure it works.
  Also various presentation and language touchups. (Martin Pool)
  (Adjusted to use doctest directly, and to not print the demo runners
  output to stderror during make check - Robert Collins)
