testscenarios goals
===================

  * nice, declarative interface for multiplying tests by scenarios.

  * plays nice with testresources - when a scenario uses a resource, the
    resource ordering logic should be able to group them together.

  * (at user discretion) plays nice with $random test discovery

  * arbitrary post-load multiplication.

  * cross-productable scenarios (for X and for Y)

  * extenable scenarios (for X using Y)

  * scenarios and the tests that use them are loosely coupled

  * tests that use scenarios should be easy to debug

  * fast

  * usable in trial, bzr, Zope testrunner, nose and the default unittest
    TestRunner
