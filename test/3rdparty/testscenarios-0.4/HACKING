Contributing to testscenarios
=============================

Code access
+++++++++++

Branch from the trunk (all patches should be for trunk unless there are
exceptional circumstances)::

  bzr branch lp:testscenarios path-to-new-local-branch

Publish your branches whereever you like, I encourage launchpad hosting though,
as it can notify me of new testscenarios branches::

  bzr push lp:~YOURUSERNAME/testscearios/YOURBRANCHNAME

Copyright
+++++++++

Testscenarios is Copyright (C) 2009 Robert Collins. I'd like to be able to
offer it up for stdlib inclusion once it has proved itself, so am asking for
copyright assignment to me - or for your contributions to be under either the
BSD or Apache-2.0 licences that Testscenarios are with (which permit inclusion
in Python).

Coding standards
++++++++++++++++

PEP-8 coding style please, though I'm not nitpicky. Make sure that 'make check'
passes before sending in a patch.

Code arrangement
++++++++++++++++

The ``testscenarios`` module should simply import classes and functions from
more specific modules, rather than becoming large and bloated itself. For
instance, TestWithScenarios lives in testscenarios.testcase, and is imported in
the testscenarios __init__.py.
