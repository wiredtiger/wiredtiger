Tracing format operations can be useful in debugging.

Turn on tracing with the "-t" flag:

    -t	Trace operations into a WiredTiger log

That causes format to write trace messages into a WiredTiger log, using WT_SESSION.log_printf()
to track operations.  Operations are logged into a separate database from the run, "OPS.TRACE"
in the run's home directory.

By default only modifications and transactions are traced to limit how much data is stored. The
-t option takes an argument, so to configure the default use an empty string, '-t ""'.

You can trace more operations by adding comma or white-space separated arguments to the -t option:

    all		trace everything
    bulk	trace bulk loads
    cursor	trace cursor operations
    read	trace read operations
    retain=N	by default, 10 log files are retained, set N to increase that number
    timestamp	trace timestamp operations (setting oldest, stable TS)

For example, to trace the usual operations, plus bulk load, and retain 25 log files, use:

    -t "bulk,retain25"

Additionally if tracing is configured, verbose messages written by the database itself will be
logged as well. For example, to trace the usual operations and include verbose block manager
operations, use:

    -C 'verbose=(block)' -t ""

After the run, you can dump the trace records from the WiredTiger log files with the wt utility,
for example:

    wt -h RUNDIR/OPS.TRACE printlog -um

The output will look something like this:

The fields are a timestamp, a thread and session ID, the program name and then an operation. When
the operation is per object (like and update or remove), there's an object name and a row number.

Additionally, when format detects a failure, it will dump the cursor page that was the source
of the row that didn't match the expected value, as well as the history store. The dumps are
in format's run directory, in files named "FAIL.pagedump" and "FAIL.HSdump".
