# Configuration for search_near_03 default test.
# The population phase will perform unique index insertions based on the number of collections and
# key count for each collection. 
# Threads:
#  - Each insert thread will perform unique index insertions on existing prefixes.
#  - Each read thread will count the number of current records in each collection, and check if the
# table has been changed.
