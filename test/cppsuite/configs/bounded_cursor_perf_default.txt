# Configuration for search_near_01.
# The test will generate key_count_per_collection number of keys for each prefix in aaa -> zzz.
# This config will have a 3 minute duration, with 3 tables of an entry for each prefix.
#
# There can only be one read thread in this test, since it manages the creation/deletion of 
# search_near_threads.
