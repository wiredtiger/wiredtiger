# Configuration for search_near_02.
# The configuration creates:
# - threads that insert random keys and values during the test. The keys have a large size to
# encourage them to be split across multiple pages.
# - threads that perform prefix search_near on random keys.
# We also configure a small cache to trigger eviction more often.
