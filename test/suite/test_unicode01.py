#   Make sure UTF8 config can be passed to WT_SESSION::create
#
#   There are a couple of tricks here:
#   1) we don't want to treat the whole file as UTF-8, because this would
#      be the only one in our tree and that causes problems for some
#      scripts; and
#   2) we can't pass in a Unicode object directly because the
#      SWIG-generated code expects a simple Python string.
