# A walk can block on a prepared update on each constituent in turn, at two different points along
# the same walk, with the two prepared transactions resolved independently and in either order. The
# walk must recover cleanly from each block on its own, switching which constituent leads as the
# blocking key on one side is passed, without conflating the two conflicts or skipping a key while
# a block is being resolved on the other side.
