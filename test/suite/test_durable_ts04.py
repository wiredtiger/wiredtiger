#
# Prepared transactions can have a durable timestamp that's greater than the commit
# timestamp. This means that the committed data becomes visible before it's durable,
# which opens a window for someone to read it and then commit and become durable
# before it, which in turn leads to inconsistency because a crash will preserve the
# second transaction but not the first.
#
# To avoid this problem, we track the durable timestamp of everything a transaction
# reads, and reject attempts to commit with durable timestamp (or commit timestamp
# if not prepared) less than that.
#
# This test makes sure that mechanism works as intended, by setting up a transaction
# with nondurable data and then handling it in a second transaction.
#
# In the first transaction,
#    - The operation may be update or remove; durable timestamps on tombstones also matter.
#    - There are two ways to set up the scenario; one involves committing before stable by
#      preparing and moving stable up, which is explicitly allowed. These scenarios are not
#      really different, but both should get checked.
#    - After commiting we can evict and/or checkpoint; on-disk durable timestamps also matter,
#      including durable stop times for deleted values.
#    - It isn't clear that both evict and checkpoint is useful; might make sense to remove
#      that combination if looking to prune the number of scenarios.
#
# In the second transaction:
#    - Reading nondurable data is always permitted.
#    - The operation can be read, remove, update, insert, or truncate; the write operations
#      can also read (which should trigger the restriction) or not ("blind write"), which
#      should not.
#    - The read can have a timestamp that is in the nondurable range, or no timestamp, which
#      also produces a nondurable read because stable hasn't been moved up.
#    - The commit can be either plain (no timestamp), timestamped, or prepared.
#    - We can try to hit the restriction (expect failure) or not:
#      - a plain commit will fail if the durable timestamp of something it read is beyond
#        stable as of when it commits, and won't if everything it read is stable.
#      - a timestamped commit will fail if its durable timestamp is before the durable
#        timestamp of something it read, and won't if its durable timestamp is the same
#        or later.
#
# Note that we filter out the case where both the first transaction and the second
# transaction do removes (including truncates) because this doesn't work -- as of this
# writing the second remove is ignored, but this is expected to change so it fails, and
# either way nothing interesting happens.
#
# We also filter out the expected failure scenario for preparing the second transaction
# because that causes a panic. Fortunately the protection scheme can be tested with an
# ordinary timestamped commit. (The prepared scenario does work correctly as of when it
# was written, but because it can't be enabled by default it doesn't help much in
# production.) It would be nice to have a debug switch to turn that panic into a Python
# exception.
#
# We do not for the moment try to create multiple unstable values in history at once.
# That should probably be tested sometime.
