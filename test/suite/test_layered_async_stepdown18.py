# A search (or search_near) followed by a walk repositions the constituent the search did not
# match, from the key the search landed on, regardless of which direction the walk then takes. That
# repositioning can land on a prepared cell even when the walk's own direction never reaches it --
# searching a key just short of a prepared one and walking away from it still probes toward the
# prepared key first. A walk resuming after that conflict must not silently treat itself as fully
# positioned again.
