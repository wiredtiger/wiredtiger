# This python test uses control points to reproduce WT-10905.
# 1. Populate data in the table
# 2. Create tombstones on all the data in the table
# 3. Enable control point to control the execution of the concurrency between two threads.
# 4. Create two threads. One thread T1 will perform reads under isolation read-uncommitted and
# another thread T2 will generate an update and a modify.
# 5. Pause T1 when the thread starts to reconstruct the modify in the update list.
# 6. Once T2 generates an update, modify and finishes rollback, signal T1 to continue.
# 7. T1 is now in an invalid state and should assert.
