# Test to do the following steps.
# 1. Prepare an update with one key (key-2)
# 2. Commit an update with another key(key-1)
# 3, Make sure both the keys are on the same page.
# 4. Set the key to full update and evict the page with release_evict
# 5. Read the page back in memory
# 6. Checkpoint
# 7. Repeat steps 5,6 and validate that the page read back into memory should
#    not be reconciled everytime with the help of btree stat.
