# hook_tiered.py
#
# Substitute tiered tables for regular (row-store) tables in Python tests.
#
# These hooks are intended for basic testing of tiered tables.  There are several
# pieces of functionality here.
#
# 1. We add tiered storage parameters to the config when calling wiredtiger_open()
#
# 2. If we create an object that is *not* a table:, we add options to its config
#    so that it will be stored local-only.  Tiered storage isn't intended (yet?) for
#    use with lsm or column store.
#
# 3. We add calls to flush_tier().  Currently we only flush after a checkpoint() call,
#    but we should add others.
#
# 4. We stub out some functions that aren't supported by tiered tables.  This will
#    break tests of those functions.  But often when they are used in other tests, we
#    can get away with returning success without performing the operation.
#
# To run, for example, the cursor tests with these hooks enabled:
#     ../test/suite/run.py --hooks tiered cursor
#
