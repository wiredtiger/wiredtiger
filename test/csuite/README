The 'test/csuite' directory includes a collection of sanity tests written in C.
They are expected to be executed as part of 'make check' testing.

Each sub directory of 'test/csuite' include source code of one csuite test, and 
should have one corresponding task in the Evergreen (CI system) configuration file. 
See 'test/evergreen.yml' for details.

When a new csuite test is introduced, a corresponding new Evergreen task should be 
crafted and put into the Evergreen configuration file. We have a utility program 
'test/evergreen/evg_cfg.py' to help with identifying and auto-generating the
Evergreen configuration for new or missing csuite tests. The program checking
has been bound into developer workflow through 'dist/s_evergreen'.
