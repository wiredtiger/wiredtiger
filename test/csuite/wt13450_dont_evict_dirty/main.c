/*
 * JIRA ticket reference: WT 13450 Don't add dirty pages in a tree to the urgent queue if checkpoint
 * is running on the same tree.
 *
 * Reproducer steps:
 *
 * - Create a clean tree with deleted content across the tree but content that can't be removed due
 * to the oldest timestamp.
 * - To clean the tree reopen the connection.
 * - Open the btree by reading a single record so it is included in checkpoint (this may be wrong,
 * we might need to dirty one page)
 * - Begin walking a cursor next, add a control point which waits once it has seen that many deleted
 * items, for them to appear deleted read after deletion timestamp
 * - The control point will save the btree ID
 * - Begin the checkpoint, trigger the cursor walking next control point so that it gets into the
 * if.
 * - Somehow verify that we did trigger that control point
