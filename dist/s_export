# This check would normally be done after the library is built, but this way
# we don't forget about a symbol during development. We usually build in the
# top-level directories, check the previously built library,
# if it exists. And, allow this script to be run from the top-level directory
# as well as locally. (??? this last wasn't true before my changes and still
# isn't)

# Check all library images that appear; typically they will be one of
#    ../build/libwiredtiger.$ext                (cmake build)
