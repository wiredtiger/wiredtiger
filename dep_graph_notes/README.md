Notes of running the `./tools/modularity_check/modularity_check.py generate_dependency_file` tool on all commits over a 2 year period and seeing what changes in the dependency file over that period.

The script to run the tool on all commits is in `mod_history.sh` and takes about 2 hours to run.
The logs produced are in `logs.txt`
Some analysis of these logs are in `analysis_of_logs.txt`
