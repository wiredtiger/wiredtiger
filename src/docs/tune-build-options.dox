/*! @page tune_build_options gcc/clang build options

WiredTiger can be built using the gcc/clang \c -fvisibility=hidden flag,
which may significantly reduce the size and load time of the WiredTiger
library when built as a dynamic shared object, and allow the optimizer
to produce better code (for example, by eliminating most lookups in the
procedure linkage table).
