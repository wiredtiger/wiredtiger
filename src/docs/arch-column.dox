/*! @arch_page arch-column Column Store

Column Stores are Btrees stored in WiredTiger that have as their
key a record id, that is, a 64 bit unsigned integer.  Thus, they implement
a specialized version of a Btree, where the key is a predictable length.

A particular kind of column store is the fixed length column store.
As its name implies, the value is fixed length, and furthermore the
value is restricted to 1 and 8 bits in length.  The bit length is specified
when the column store is created.  The fixed length column store
has specialized use cases like bitmaps.

The more general case is the variable length column store which allows
for values that have any length, and may have arbitrary types, including
aggregates of various types.

Internally, row stores and both kinds of column stores all use a common
\c WT_BTREE structure.  Column stores are distinguished in that
<code>WT_BTREE->type == BTREE_COL_VAR</code> for variable length column stores
and <code>WT_BTREE->type == BTREE_COL_FIX</code> for fixed length column stores.
Internal functions that navigate, access and manipulate Btrees have
code sprinkled throughout that is conditional on <code>WT_BTREE->type</code>.
