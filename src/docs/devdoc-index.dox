Most applications begin to make use of WiredTiger by creating a table (or other
data object) to store their data in. Create is one of several schema operations
available in WiredTiger.

For more information on how schema operations are implemented in WiredTiger,
see:

- @subpage devdoc-schema

An internal structure called Data Handle (dhandle) is used to represent and
access a table in WiredTiger. A dhandle gets created when a table is accessed
for the first time. It is kept in a global list and is shared across the
sessions.  When a dhandle is not needed anymore and has been idle for a while,
it is closed and destroyed, releasing all the resources associated with it.

For more information on the lifecycle of a dhandle, see:

- @subpage devdoc-dhandle-lifecycle
