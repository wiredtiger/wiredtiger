/*! @arch_page arch-data-file Data File Format

The format of the WiredTiger data file is given by structures
in \c block.h , defining the overall structure of the file and
its blocks.  The \c WT_BLOCK_DESC starts the file.  Following that,
individual pages appear, each with a \c WT_PAGE_HEADER defined in \c btmem.h
and a \c WT_BLOCK_HEADER defined in \c block.h .  Individual cells then
sequentially appear as defined in \c cell.h .  Each cell encodes
a key or value.  Ordering is important, values are all associated with
the key that precedes them.  Multiple values may be present, which
can represent multiple versions.  Extremely large values may be represented
as a reference to another page.

The exact encoding is rather complex, and beyond what can be described here.
The encoding strikes a balance between data that can be compacted efficiently
in time and space, extensibility, and compatibility with previous versions.
