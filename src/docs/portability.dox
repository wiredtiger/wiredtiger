/*! @page portability General information on portability

@section cpu Supported CPU architectures

The supported list of CPU target architectures may be found by inspecting the \c WT_ARCH variable
present in the \c cmake configuration. Note that the \c loongarch64 platform is community-supported.

@section posix POSIX compliance

WiredTiger aims to be generally portable to any 64-bit system supporting the ANSI C11 and POSIX
1003.1 standards. Unfortunately, the real world is a little messier than the standards dictate, so
WiredTiger may not compile (or work correctly) on every POSIX platform.

If WiredTiger does fail to compile (or work correctly) on your platform, we welcome either a
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/wiki/Creating-tickets-that-are-likely-to-be-actioned">bug report</a>
or a
<a href="https://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger/wiki/Contributing-to-WiredTiger">pull request</a>.

@section testing Testing

To see a list of the CPU and operating system combinations WiredTiger is currently tested on, please
visit <a href="https://evergreen.mongodb.com/waterfall/wiredtiger">our test results page</a>. This
list is determined by the availability of suitable machines. The lack of an operating system or CPU
architecture on this page does not make it unsupported.
