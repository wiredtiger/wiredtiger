/*! @page bulk_load Bulk-load

WiredTiger cursors can be configured for bulk-load using the \c bulk
configuration keyword to WT_SESSION::open_cursor.  Bulk-load is a "fast
path" for quickly loading a large number of rows.  Bulk-load may only
be used on newly created objects, and an object being bulk-loaded is not
accessible from other cursors.

Cursors configured for bulk-load only support the WT_CURSOR::insert and
WT_CURSOR::close methods.

When bulk-loading row-store objects, keys must be loaded in sorted
order.

When using the \c sort utility on a Linux or other POSIX-like system to
pre-sort keys, the locale specified by the environment affects the sort
order and may not match the default sort order used by WiredTiger.  Set
\c LC_ALL=C in the process' environment to configure the traditional sort
order that uses native byte values.

When bulk-loading fixed-length column store objects, the \c bulk
configuration string value \c bitmap allows chunks of a memory resident
bitmap to be loaded directly into an object by passing a WT_ITEM to
WT_CURSOR::set_value, where the size field indicates the number of
records in the bitmap (as specified by the object's \c value_format
configuration). Bulk-loaded bitmap values must end on a byte boundary
relative to the bit count (except for the last set of values loaded).
