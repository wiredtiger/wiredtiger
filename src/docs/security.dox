@section directory_permissions Database directory permissions

All WiredTiger files are stored in the database home directory, and the
WiredTiger database directory should have its permissions set to ensure
database objects are not accessible to users without appropriate
permissions.  See @ref home for more information.

@section file_permissions File permissions

WiredTiger creates file system objects readable and writable by the
process owner, group and user, as modified by the process' umask value.
The group ownership of created file system objects may vary depending
on the system, and is not controlled by WiredTiger.

@section environment_variables Environment variables

Consider security when configuring WiredTiger to use the WIREDTIGER_HOME
environment variable, especially in applications which run with
permissions other than the user's.  Such applications are potentially
vulnerable to allowing users access to databases they could not
otherwise access.  See @ref home for more information.
