/*! @class doc_tune_durability_group_commit

WiredTiger automatically groups the flush operations for threads that
commit concurrently into single calls.  This usually means
multi-threaded workloads will achieve higher throughput than
single-threaded workloads because the operating system can flush data
more efficiently to the disk.  No application-level configuration is
required for this feature.

/*! @class doc_tune_durability_flush_config

By default, log records are written to an in-memory buffer before
WT_SESSION::commit_transaction returns, giving highest performance but
not ensuring durability.  The durability guarantees can be stricter but
will impact performance.

If \c transaction_sync=(enabled=false) is configured to ::wiredtiger_open,
log records may be buffered in memory, and only flushed to disk by
checkpoints, when log files switch or calls to WT_SESSION::commit_transaction
with \c sync=on.  (Note that any call to WT_SESSION::commit_transaction
with \c sync=on will flush the log records for all committed transactions,
not just the transaction where the configuration is set.)  This provides the
minimal guarantees, but will be significantly faster than other configurations.

If \c transaction_sync=(enabled=true), \c transaction_sync=(method)
further configures the method used to flush log records to disk.  By
default, the configured value is \c fsync, which calls the operating
system's \c fsync call (of \c fdatasync if available) as each commit completes.

If the value is set to \c dsync, the \c O_DSYNC or \c O_SYNC
flag to the operating system's \c open call will be specified when the
file is opened.  (The durability guarantee of the \c fsync and \c dsync
configurations are the same, and in our experience the \c open flags are
slower, this configuration is only included for systems where that may
not be the case.)

If the value is set to \c none, the operating system's \c write call
will be called as each commit completes but does not flush to disk.
This setting gives durability at the application level but not at
the system level.

When a log file fills and the system moves to the next log file, the
previous log file will always be flushed to disk prior to close.  So
when running in a durability mode that does not flush to disk, the risk
is bounded by the most recent log file change.

Here is the expected performance of durability modes, in order from the
fastest to the slowest (and from the fewest durability guarantees to the
most durability guarantees).
