/*! @page checkpoints Checkpoints

WiredTiger supports checkpoints, a read-only, static view of one or
more data sources.

Checkpoints offer basic operation durability without transactional
logging, across application or system failure.  (Transactional logging
offers fine-grained durability, but requires a recovery step when files
are first opened, and impacts the performance of every operation;
checkpoints offer durability without recovery or impacting performance,
but the creation of a checkpoint is a relatively heavy-weight operation.
WiredTiger does not yet support transactional logging.)

Checkpoints are automatically created whenever a modified data source is
closed.

When WiredTiger data sources are first opened, they are opened in the
state of the most recent checkpoint taken on the file, in other words,
updates after the most recent checkpoint will not appear in the data
source.  If no checkpoint is found when the data source is opened, the
data source will appear empty.

Checkpoints may optionally be named.  Named checkpoints are created and
discarded using the WT_SESSION::checkpoint method and read using the
WT_SESSION::open_cursor method.  Additionally, the \c -c option to the
\c wt command line utility \c list command will list a data source's
checkpoints in a human-readable format.

Cursors are opened in the most recent version of a data source unless a
checkpoint name is provided to WT_SESSION::open_cursor.  Cursors opened
in the most recent version of a data source support write operations,
cursors opened in a checkpoint are read-only.

Named checkpoints persist until explicitly dropped.  Checkpoints share
pages, and deleting a checkpoint may or may not make pages available for
re-use, depending on whether the dropped checkpoint contained the last
reference to a block of data.  Creating a named checkpoint automatically
discards any previous checkpoints with the same name.

Named checkpoints may not be discarded if in use or when hot backups are
in progress.

Unnamed checkpoints managed by WiredTiger are given the reserved name
"WiredTigerCheckpoint".
