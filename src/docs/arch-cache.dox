/*! @arch_page arch-cache Cache

Cache in WiredTiger is represented by the various shared data structures
that make up in-memory Btrees and subordinate data structures.

Memory used to read in and write out the on-disk representations of Btrees
is not cached, it only exists temporarily during the I/O operation and
while the data is transferred to or from the on-disk format.

Internally, the current cache state is represented by the WT_CACHE structure,
which contains various counters that drive statistics and information
used for eviction.
