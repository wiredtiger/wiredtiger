/*! @page compact Compaction

The WT_SESSION::compact method can be used to compact data sources.

The data source does not have to be quiescent, compaction may be
performed on an active data source.

Because checkpoints named by the application are not discarded until
explicitly removed or replaced, they may prevent WT_SESSION::compact
from accomplishing anything.
