/*! @page keyvalue Key/Value pairs

Underlying WiredTiger files are key/value stores, that is, entries in
the file are paired keys and values.  These keys and values can be
accessed directly, and a file cursor will only return the data from the
single file, without reference to any other related files or data.  For
example, if an index were lost or to become inconsistent with its
primary, a file cursor could read from the index without problems (even
though some of the returned keys might not exist in the primary).

In the case of a row-store file, keys and values are both
variable-length byte strings, up to (4GB - 512B) in length.
