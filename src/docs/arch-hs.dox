/*! @arch_page arch-hs History Store

The History Store in WiredTiger tracks old (all but the latest committed)
versions of records.  By having these records in storage separate from
the current version, they can be used to service long running transactions,
and be evicted as necessary, without interfering with activity that uses
the most recent committed versions.
