/*! @arch_page arch-transaction Transactions

Transactions provide a powerful abstraction for multiple threads to operate on data concurrently.
A caller of WiredTiger uses @ref transactions within the API to start and stop transactions within
a session (thread of control).

Internally, the current transaction state is represented by the WT_TXN structure.
