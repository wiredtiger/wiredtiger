@section windows_github Building using Git and GitHub

Skip this step if you are building from a WiredTiger release package,
and proceed with @ref windows_building

First, clone the repository:

@code
git clone git://github.com/wiredtiger/wiredtiger.git
@endcode

Now proceed with @ref windows_building

@section windows_building Building on Windows

Building WiredTiger on Windows requires
<a href="http://www.scons.org">SCons</a> as well as the Microsoft Visual
C++ compiler in Microsoft Visual Studio.

Change directory to the top-level directory, then build the software:

@code
cd wiredtiger
scons
@endcode

To rebuild from scratch, discard any previous configuration by cleaning
out the build area:

@code
scons -c
@endcode

To see additional configuration options, run:

@code
scons --help
@endcode

To build the python language support, a 64-bit version of Python is
required.  The required version is referred to as x86-64 on
<a href="www.python.org">Python.org</a> or x64 on
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads">
ActiveState Python</a>.

@section windows_installing Installing WiredTiger

The WiredTiger software consists of a library and a single standalone
utility.

WiredTiger's distribution follows the GNU Coding Standards installation
guidelines, and by default WiredTiger builds and installs a static library
and dll version of the library.

@code
file <root directory>/package/bin/
wt.exe:			x64 standalone executable
wiredtiger.dll:		x64 dynamically linked library

file <root directory>/package/lib/
libwiredtiger.lib:	x64 static library
wiredtiger.lib:		x64 import library for dll
@endcode

To install WiredTiger:

@code
scons install
@endcode

To install WiredTiger's libraries or binaries into alternate locations,
you can use the --prefix configuration option.

@code
scons --prefix=c:\wiredtiger install
@endcode
