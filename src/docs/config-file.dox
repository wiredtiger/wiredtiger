/*! @page database_config Database Configuration

WiredTiger databases are accessed through the ::wiredtiger_open call,
which takes a configuration string argument.  In addition to this, the
database configuration can be specified in a file or an environment
variable.

@section config_file \c WiredTiger.config File

If a file named \c WiredTiger.config appears in the WiredTiger home
directory, it is read as a configuration string.  Configuration values
specified in the \c config argument to ::wiredtiger_open override
configuration values specified in the \c WIREDTIGER_CONFIG environment
variable, which in turn override values in the \c WiredTiger.config file.

The file is minimally parsed in order to build configuration strings
for the WiredTiger configuration parser:

<ul>
<li>A backslash (<b><tt>\\</tt></b>) followed by any character other
than a newline character leaves both characters untouched; otherwise,
if a backslash is followed by a newline character, both the backslash
and the newline character are discarded.

<li>Any text between double-quote pairs (<b><tt>"</tt></b>) is left
untouched, including newline and white-space characters.   Backslash
characters escape double-quote characters: a backslash escaped
double-quote character can neither start or end a quoted string.

<li>Comments are discarded.  If the first non-white-space character
following an unquoted and unescaped newline character is a hash mark
(<b><tt>#</tt></b>), all characters up to the next newline character are
discarded.  The ending newline character cannot be escaped or quoted,
once a comment line is identified, all characters to the next newline
are simply discarded.

<li>Otherwise, all lines are concatenated and the newline characters
replaced with commas.
</ul>

@section config_env Configuring with an environment variable

If set, the \c WIREDTIGER_CONFIG environment variable will read, and the
string added to the configuration values for ::wiredtiger_open.
Configuration values specified in the \c config argument to
::wiredtiger_open override configuration values specified in the
\c WIREDTIGER_CONFIG environment variable, which in turn override values
in the \c WiredTiger.config file.

If the process is running with special privileges and \c WIREDTIGER_CONFIG
is set, the ::wiredtiger_open function must be configured with the
\c use_environment_priv flag, or the call to ::wiredtiger_open will fail.
See @ref home for more details.
