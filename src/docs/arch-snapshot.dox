/*! @arch_page arch-snapshot Snapshot

When the snapshot isolation level is used in WiredTiger, the transaction
will see versions of records committed before the transaction started.

Snapshots are implemented by storing the set of transaction ids committed
before the transaction started in the \c WT_TXN structure.  Transaction
ids older than a certain point need not be stored.
