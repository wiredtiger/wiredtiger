@subpage arch-glossary

WiredTiger assigns specific meanings to certain words. Here we decode them.

@subpage arch-schema

Most applications begin to make use of WiredTiger by creating a table (or other
data object) to store their data in. Create is one of several schema operations
available in WiredTiger.

@subpage arch-dhandle-lifecycle

An internal structure called Data Handle (dhandle) is used to represent and
access a table in WiredTiger. A dhandle gets created when a table is accessed
for the first time. It is kept in a global list and is shared across the
sessions.  When a dhandle is not needed anymore and has been idle for a while,
it is closed and destroyed, releasing all the resources associated with it.
