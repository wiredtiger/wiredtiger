/*! @m_page{{c,java},cursor_random,Cursor random}

The \c next_random configuration to the WT_SESSION::open_cursor method
configures the cursor to return a pseudo-random record from a row-store
object (the configuration is not supported on other types of objects).
The configuration has somewhat unusual semantics: first, the returned
record may not be very random in the case of objects with only a few
rows. Additionally, even in larger objects, the WT_CURSOR::next method
generally returns the first record from a random page in the underlying
file, not a random record from a random page.
