/*! @page cursor_random Cursor random

The \c next_random configuration to the WT_SESSION::open_cursor method
configures the cursor to return a pseudo-random record from a row-store
object (the \c next_random configuration is not supported on other types
of objects).

Applications should use the WT_CURSOR::next method to retrieve records
from the object, most other cursor methods are not supported. For
example, it's not possible to update using a cursor configured for
random retrieval.

By default, each returned record is pseudo-randomly selected from the
underlying object as a whole. That can lead to skewed results when the
underlying tree structure is unbalanced or records are not uniformly
distributed. In such cases, the \c next_random_sample_size configuration
can also be specified. Setting \c next_random_sample_size configures the
number of samples the application expects to take using the cursor. A
cursor configured using \c next_random_sample_size divides the object
into \c next_random_sample_size pieces, and each subsequent retrieval
returns a record from the next one of those pieces.
