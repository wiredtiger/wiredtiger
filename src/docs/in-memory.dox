/*! @page in_memory In-memory databases

The ::wiredtiger_open \c in_memory configuration changes WiredTiger to
run in cache without writing to a backing disk. Data is limited to the
configured cache size.

If \c in_memory is configured, WT_CURSOR::insert and WT_CURSOR::update
methods may return an additional error, ::WT_CACHE_FULL, indicating the
insert or update operation requires more than the configured cache size
to complete. If a transaction is in progress, it should be rolled back.
