/*! @arch_page arch-fs-os File System and Operating System Interface

Internally, a layer of abstraction is above all operating system calls,
allowing main line WiredTiger code to make a call to single set of interfaces.
There are currently OS specific APIs for POSIX and Windows.

Additionally, a program can use WT_CONNECTION::set_file_system to register
a set of functions that will be called for each file system operation.
WiredTiger will then call these functions at the appropriate time.
