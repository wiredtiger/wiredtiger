@section version_13 Upgrading to Version 1.3

<dl>

<dt>Checkpoint and Snapshot</dt>
<dd>
The checkpoint functionality supported by WT_SESSION::checkpoint and the
snapshot functionality supported by WT_SESSION::sync have been merged
into a single piece of functionality.

<ul>
<li>WT_SESSION.checkpoint<br>
The WT_SESSION::checkpoint method's \c snapshot configuration string has
been renamed to \c name.

<li>WT_SESSION.drop<br>
In releases before 1.3, the WT_SESSION::drop method was used to delete
snapshots.  In 1.3, the functionality of deleting snapshots has been
moved to the WT_SESSION::checkpoint method, specifically, snapshots are
discarded using the WT_SESSION::checkpoint method's \c drop configuration
string.

<li>WT_SESSION.sync<br>
The WT_SESSION::sync method has been removed from the 1.3 release; the
functionality of creating an object snapshot has moved to the
WT_SESSION::checkpoint method, specifically, creating a snapshot of a
one or more objects is done using the WT_SESSION::checkpoint method's
\c target configuration string.

<li>wt drop -s<br>
The \c -s option to the \c drop command for the \c wt command line
utility has been removed, and object snapshots may no longer be removed
from the command line.

<li>wt dump, list -s<br>
The \c -s options to the \c dump and \c list commands for the \c wt
command line utility have been renamed to be \c -c.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>WT_SESSION.open_cursor</dt>
<dd>
In releases before 1.3, the WT_SESSION::open_cursor method could duplicate
cursors that were not positioned in an object; in 1.3, a cursor must be
positioned in order to be duplicated.
</dd>

<dt>Transactional cursors</dt>
<dd>
In releases before 1.3, ending a transaction by calling the
WT_SESSION::commit_transaction or WT_SESSION::rollback_transaction methods
implicitly closed all open cursors; in 1.3, the cursors remain open, but are
reset (discarding their positions and cursor values).  This means applications
must change to either close cursors explicitly, or rely on an eventual
WT_SESSION::close or WT_CONNECTION::close methods to implicitly close open
cursors.
</dd>

<dt>Default transactional isolation level</dt>
<dd>
In releases before 1.3, the default isolation level was <code>snapshot</code>;
in 1.3, the default isolation level is <code>read-committed</code>.
</dd>

<dt>WT_CURSOR.equals</dt>
<dd>
In releases before 1.3, the WT_CURSOR::equals method returned zero/non-zero
to indicate cursor equality; in 1.3, WT_CURSOR::equals returns a standard error
status, and cursor equality is returned in an additional parameter specified
to the method.
</dd>

<dt>Version 1.3 file format changes</dt>
<dd>
The underlying file formats changed in the 1.3 release; tables and files
should be dumped and re-loaded into a new database.
</dd>
