/*! @arch_page arch-row Row Store

Row Stores are Btrees stored in WiredTiger that do not have a record id
as key.  Thus, they implement a generalized version of a Btree, where
the key and data can be arbitrary length.

Internally, a row store and column store both use a common \c WT_BTREE
structure.  The fundamental difference is that
<code>WT_BTREE->type == BTREE_ROW</code> for row stores.
Internal functions that navigate, access and manipulate Btrees have
code sprinkled throughout that is conditional on <code>WT_BTREE->type</code>.
