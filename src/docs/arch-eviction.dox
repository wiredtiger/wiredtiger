/*! @arch_page arch-eviction Eviction

Eviction represents the process or removing old data from the cache,
writing it to disk if it is dirty. The general strategy uses a dedicated
set of eviction threads that are tasked with identifying candidate data.
If the data needs to be written, it is reconciled (converting the
in-memory format to on-disk format), and then written. Clean memory
can be freed if needed.

Eviction cannot be triggered directly by API calls, but happens as a result
of enough data being dirtied.

Eviction is managed using \c WT_EVICT_QUEUE structures,
each of which contains a list of \c WT_EVICT_ENTRY structures.
