/*! @arch_page arch-dhandle Data Handles and Btrees

An internal structure called a Data Handle (dhandle) is used to represent and
access Btrees and other data sources in WiredTiger. A dhandle is created
when a table is accessed for the first time. It is kept in a global list
and is shared across the sessions.  When a dhandle is not needed anymore
and has been idle for a while, it is closed and destroyed, releasing all the
resources associated with it.

A Btree is one kind of dhandle. It embodies both the on-disk and in-memory
representations of the Btree.

@subpage arch-dhandle-lifecycle

This section describes how dhandles are created, and how and when they are destroyed.
