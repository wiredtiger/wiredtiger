/*! @page signals Signal handling

WiredTiger has no signal handlers and does not modify process signal handler behavior in any way.

WiredTiger restarts any system calls interrupted by a signal.

WiredTiger applications exiting as a result of a signal should exit WiredTiger gracefully, closing any open WiredTiger handles, before terminating the process.

WiredTiger is not re-entrant, and applications using WiredTiger should not make WiredTiger API calls from signal handlers.
