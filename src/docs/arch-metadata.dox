/*! @arch_page arch-metadata Metadata

Metadata in WiredTiger is stored as a table in the \c "WiredTiger.wt" file.
The table's key is a \c uri string, and the value is its complete
configuration string.  The configuration itself is a list of key/value
pairs in string form.  The configuration's keys are dependent on the
type of \c uri.  Thus, a metadata entry with a \c uri key beginning with
\c "table:" will be a configuration string
having configuration entries like \c key_format and \c value_format to
describe the data encoding for the uri.  A metadata key beginning with
\c "file:" will have a different set of configuration entries associated
with it.

A caller of WiredTiger can use WT_SESSION::open_cursor with a \c uri equal to
\c "meta:" to read the metadata.  Using this interface, metadata can only
be queried, not changed.  Changes to the metadata are affected by API calls
such as WT_SESSION::create, WT_SESSION::drop, WT_SESSION::rename.
