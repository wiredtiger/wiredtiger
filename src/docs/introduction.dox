/*! @mainpage Reference Guide

WiredTiger is an high performance, scalable, production quality, NoSQL,
Open Source extensible platform for data management.

WiredTiger supports both traditional row-oriented storage, where all
columns of a row are stored together, and column-oriented storage, where
one or more columns can be stored individually, allowing more efficient
access and storage.

For more information on the WiredTiger architecture and why it might be
right for your project, see:

- @subpage architecture

This documentation describes the programming interface to WiredTiger
used by developers to construct applications.  We follow SQL
terminology: a database is set of tables managed together.  Tables
consist of rows, where each row is a key and its associated value.
Tables may optionally have an associated schema, splitting the value
into a set of columns.  Tables may also have associated indices, each
of which is ordered by one or more columns.

WiredTiger distributions are tested on Linux, FreeBSD and OS X.
WiredTiger is portable to any 64-bit system supporting the ANSI C99,
POSIX 1003.1 and POSIX 1003.1c (threads extension) standards.
