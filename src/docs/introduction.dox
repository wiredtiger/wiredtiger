/*! @mainpage Reference Guide

WiredTiger is an high performance, scalable, production quality, NoSQL,
Open Source extensible platform for data management.

WiredTiger supports row-oriented storage (where all columns of a row are
stored together), column-oriented storage (where columns are stored in
groups, allowing for more efficient access and storage of column
subsets) and log-structured merge trees (LSM), for sustained throughput
under random insert workloads.

WiredTiger includes ACID transactions with standard isolation levels and
durability at both checkpoint and fine-grained granularity.

WiredTiger can be used as a simple key/value store, but also has a
complete schema layer, including indices and projections.

WiredTiger should be generally portable to any 64-bit system supporting
the ANSI C99, POSIX 1003.1 and POSIX 1003.1c (threads extension) standards.
