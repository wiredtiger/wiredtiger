@section remote Remote file systems

WiredTiger objects may be stored on remote file systems if the remote
file system conforms to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (POSIX.1).  In the case of
read-only objects, multiple systems may access the objects
simultaneously; objects which are written cannot be accessed by more
than a single system.  Because remote file systems are often slower than
local file systems, using a remote file system for storage may degrade
performance.
