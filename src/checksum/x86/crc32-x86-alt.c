 * Here be dragons!
 * The intrin.h include file is in a different place for the 4.0 release of
 * MongoDB than it is for the 4.2 release. There was a bug in the 4.0 release
 * which caused checksums to be invalid if they weren't 8 byte aligned and a
 * multiple of 8 bytes long. That bug is fixed by including the intrin.h header
 * file.
 *
 * We want to keep writing the old format when running in MongoDB 4.0 so
 * users can downgrade and do point release upgrades without concern of a data
 * format changes. We also want users to be able to downgrade from 4.2 to 4.0
 * without pain. We achieve that by including this fixed version of the checksum
 * implementation. It works because when a checksum fails we automatically try
 * the alternative checksum. In the case of 4.0 the alternative is the correct
 * checksum. In the case of 4.2 the alternative is the old style checksum - i.e
 * it's important that intrin.h is included in this file in 4.0 and in the
 * non-alternate checksum implementation in 4.2.
