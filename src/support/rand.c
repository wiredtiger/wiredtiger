#include "wt_internal.h"

/*
 * An implementation of George Marsaglia's multiply-with-carry pseudo-random number generator.
 * Computationally fast, with reasonable randomness properties, and a claimed period of > 2^60.
 *
 * Be very careful about races here. Multiple threads can call __wt_random concurrently, and it is
 * okay if those concurrent calls get the same return value. What is *not* okay is if
 * reading/writing the shared state races and uses two different values for m_w or m_z. That can
 * result in a stored value of zero, in which case they will be stuck on zero forever. Take a local
 * copy of the values to avoid that, and read/write in atomic, 8B chunks.
 *
 * Please do not modify the behavior of __wt_random when it is used with the default seed. We have
 * verified that it produces good-quality randomness for our uses within the WiredTiger library, so
 * we would like to preserve its current behavior.
