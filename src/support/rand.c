 * random number generator.  Computationally fast, with reasonable randomness
 * properties.
 *
 * We have to be very careful about races here.  Multiple threads can call
 * __wt_random concurrently, and it is okay if those concurrent calls get the
 * same return value.  What is *not* okay is if reading the shared state races
 * with an update and uses two different values for m_w or m_z.  That could
 * result in a value of zero, in which case they would be stuck on zero
 * forever.  Take local copies of the shared values to avoid this.
