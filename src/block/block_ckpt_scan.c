/*
 * In historic WiredTiger files, it wasn't possible to open standalone files,
 * you're done if you lose the file's associated metadata. That was a mistake
 * and this code is the workaround. First, we store file creation metadata in
 * the file's descriptor block. The file creation metadata is enough to read
 * a file: it includes allocation size, compression, encryptors and so on, with
 * it we can open a file and read the blocks. The other thing we need to verify
 * a file is a list of active checkpoints as of the file's clean shutdown (also
 * normally stored in the database metadata). The last write done in a block
 * manager's checkpoint is the avail list. If we include checkpoint information
 * with that write, we're close. We can then open the file, read the blocks,
 * scan until we find the avail list, and read the active checkpoint information
 * from there.
 *	Two problems remain: first, the checkpoint information can't be correct
 * until we write the avail list, the checkpoint information has to include the
 * avail list address plus the final file size after the write. Fortunately,
 * when scanning the file for the avail lists, we're figuring out exactly the
 * information needed to fix up the checkpoint information we wrote, that is,
 * the avail list's offset, size and checksum triplet. As for the final file
 * size, we allocate space in the file before we calculate the block's checksum,
 * so we can do that allocation and then fill in the final file size before
 * writing the block.
 *	The second problem is we have to be able to find the avail lists that
 * include checkpoint information (ignoring previous files created by previous
 * releases, and, of course, making upgrade/downgrade work seamlessly). Extent
 * list are written to their own pages, and we could version this change using
 * the page header version. Extent lists have WT_PAGE_BLOCK_MANAGER page types,
 * we could version this change using the upcoming WT_PAGE_VERSION_TS upgrade.
 * However, that requires waiting a release (we would have to first release a
 * version that ignores those new page header versions so downgrade works), and
 * we're not planning a release that writes WT_PAGE_VERSION_TS page headers for
 * awhile. Happily, historic WiredTiger releases have a bug. Extent lists
 * consist of a set of offset/size pairs, with magic offset/size pairs at the
 * beginning and end of the list. Historic releases only verified the offset of
 * the special pairs, ignoring the size. To detect avail lists that include the
 * checkpoint information, this change adds a version to the extent list: if the
 * size is WT_BLOCK_EXTLIST_VERSION_CKPT, then checkpoint information follows.
