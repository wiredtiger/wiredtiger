 * However, in the WT_UPDATE structure we use the UINT32_MAX size as a "deleted"
 * flag, and second, the size of an overflow object is constrained by what an
 * underlying block manager can actually write.  (For example, in the default
 * block manager, writing an overflow item includes the underlying block's page
 * header and block manager specific structure, aligned to an allocation-sized
 * unit).  The btree engine limits the size of a single object to (4GB - 1KB);
 * that gives us additional bytes if we ever want to store a structure length
 * plus the object size in 4B, or if we need additional flag values.  Attempts
 * to store large key/value items in the tree trigger an immediate check to the
 * block manager, to make sure it can write the item.  Storing 4GB objects in a
 * btree borders on clinical insanity, anyway.
 *
 * Record numbers are stored in 64-bit unsigned integers, meaning the largest
 * record number is "really, really big".
