/*
 * The block manager maintains three per-checkpoint extent lists:
 *	alloc:	 the extents allocated in this checkpoint
 *	avail:	 the extents available for allocation
 *	discard: the extents freed in this checkpoint
 * Each of the extent lists is based on two skiplists: first, a by-offset list
 * linking WT_EXT elements and sorted by file offset (low-to-high), second, a
 * by-size list linking WT_SIZE elements and sorted by chunk size (low-to-high).
 *	Additionally, each WT_SIZE element on the by-size has a skiplist of its
 * own, linking WT_EXT elements and sorted by file offset (low-to-high).  This
 * list has an entry for extents of a particular size.
 *	The trickiness is that each individual WT_EXT element appears on two
 * skiplists.  In order to minimize allocation calls, we allocate a single
 * array of WT_EXT pointers at the end of the WT_EXT structure, for both
 * skiplists, and store the depth of the skiplist in the WT_EXT structure.
 * The skiplist entries for the offset skiplist start at WT_EXT.next[0] and
 * the entries for the size skiplist start at WT_EXT.next[WT_EXT.depth].
 *
 * XXX
 * We maintain the per-size skiplists for the alloc and discard extent lists,
 * but there's no reason for that, the avail list is the only list we search
 * by size.
