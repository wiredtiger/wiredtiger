/*
 * Atomic writes:
 *
 * WiredTiger requires pointers (void *) and some variables to be read/written
 * atomically, that is, in a single cycle.  This is not write ordering -- to be
 * clear, the requirement is that no partial value can ever be read or written.
 * For example, if 8-bits of a 32-bit quantity were written, then the rest of
 * the 32-bits were written, and another thread of control was able to read the
 * memory location after the first 8-bits were written and before the subsequent
 * 24-bits were written, WiredTiger would break.   Or, if two threads of control
 * attempt to write the same location simultaneously, the result must be one or
 * the other of the two values, not some combination of both.
 *
 * To reduce memory requirements, we use a 32-bit type on 64-bit machines, which
 * is OK if the compiler doesn't accumulate two adjacent 32-bit variables into a
 * single 64-bit write, that is, there needs to be a single load/store of the 32
 * bits, not a load/store of 64 bits, where the 64 bits is comprised of two
 * adjacent 32-bit locations.  The problem is when two threads are cooperating
 * (thread X finds 32-bits set to 0, writes in a new value, flushes memory;
 * thread Y reads 32-bits that are non-zero, does some operation, resets the
 * memory location to 0 and flushes).   If thread X were to read the 32 bits
 * adjacent to a different 32 bits, and write them both, the two threads could
 * race.  If that can happen, you must increase the size of the memory type to
 * a type guaranteed to be written atomically in a single cycle, without writing
 * an adjacent memory location.
 *
 * WiredTiger doesn't require atomic writes for any 64-bit memory locations and
 * can run on machines with a 32-bit memory bus.
 *
 * We don't depend on writes across cache lines being atomic, and to make sure
 * that never happens, we check address alignment: we know of no architectures
 * with cache lines other than a multiple of 4 bytes in size, so aligned 4-byte
 * accesses will always be in a single cache line.
 *
 * Atomic writes are often associated with memory barriers, implemented by the
 * WT_READ_BARRIER and WT_WRITE_BARRIER macros.  WiredTiger's requirement as
 * described by the Solaris membar_enter description:
 *
 *	No stores from after the memory barrier will reach visibility and
 *	no loads from after the barrier will be resolved before the lock
 *	acquisition reaches global visibility
 *
 * In other words, the WT_WRITE_BARRIER macro must ensure that memory stores by
 * the processor, made before the WT_WRITE_BARRIER call, be visible to all
 * processors in the system before any memory stores by the processor, made
 * after the WT_WRITE_BARRIER call, are visible to any processor.  The
 * WT_READ_BARRIER macro ensures that all loads before the barrier are complete
 * before any loads after the barrier.  The compiler cannot reorder or cache
 * values across a barrier.
 *
 * Lock and unlock operations imply both read and write barriers.  In other
 * words, barriers are not required for values protected by locking.
 *
 * Data locations may also be marked volatile, forcing the compiler to re-load
 * the data on each access.  This is a weaker semantic than barriers provide,
 * only ensuring that the compiler will not cache values.  It makes no ordering
 * guarantees and may have no effect on systems with weaker cache guarantees.
 *
 * In summary, locking > barriers > volatile.
 *
 * To avoid locking shared data structures such as statistics and to permit
 * atomic state changes, we rely on the WT_ATOMIC_ADD and WT_ATOMIC_CAS
 * (compare and swap) operations.
