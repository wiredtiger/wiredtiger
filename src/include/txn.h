 * Transaction ID comparison dealing with edge cases and wrapping.
 *
 * WT_TXN_ABORTED is the largest possible ID (never visible to a running
 * transaction), WT_TXN_NONE is smaller than any possible ID (visible to all
 * running transactions).
 *
 * Otherwise, we deal with 32-bit wrapping by looking at the difference between
 * the two IDs.  In what follows, "small" means less than 2^31 and "large"
 * means greater than 2^31.
 *
 * If t2 > t1 and neither has wrapped, then (t2 - t1) is small.  It is
 * certainly smaller than t2, and we assume that we never compare IDs that
 * differ by more than 2^31.  If t2 has wrapped (so it is small) and t1 is
 * large, then (t2 - t1) = (t2 + (-t1)) will be small.
 *
 * In effect, we have a 31-bit window of active transaction IDs: if an update
 * remains in the system after 2 billion transactions it can no longer be
 * compared with current transaction ID.
