	 *
	 * One half of that test is in the reconciliation code: the checkpoint

	 * is the best test, but it's not set anywhere for the root page, it's
	 * not a complete test.

	 * Quit for any page that's not a simple, in-memory page.  (Almost the
	 * same as checking for the checkpoint-walk flag.  I don't think there
	 * are code paths that change the page's status from checkpoint-walk,
	 * but these races are hard enough I'm not going to proceed if there's
