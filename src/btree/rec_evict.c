	 * page life-cycle if it grows too large and must be pushed out of the

	 * be empty when evicted, but that only happens when the tree is closed.
	 *
	 * Fail if any page in the top-level page's subtree can't be merged into
	 * its parent.  You can't evict a page that references such in-memory
	 * pages, they must be evicted first.  The test is necessary but should
	 * not fire much: the LRU-based eviction code is biased for leaf pages,
	 * an internal page shouldn't be selected for LRU-based eviction until
	 * its children have been evicted.  Empty, split and split-merge pages
	 * are all included in this test, they can all be merged into a parent.
	 *
	 * We have to write dirty pages to know their final state, a page marked
	 * empty may have had records added since reconciliation, a page marked
	 * split may have had records deleted and no longer need to split.
	 * Split-merge pages are the exception: they can never be change into
	 * anything other than a split-merge page and are merged regardless of
	 * being clean or dirty.
	 *
	 * Writing the page is expensive, do a cheap test first: if it doesn't
	 * appear a subtree page can be merged, quit.  It's possible the page
	 * has been emptied since it was last reconciled, and writing it before
	 * testing might be worthwhile, but it's more probable we're attempting
	 * to evict an internal page with live children, and that's a waste of
	 * time.
	 *
	 * We don't do a cheap test for the top-level page: we're not called
	 * to evict split-merge pages, which means the only interesting case
