 * Helper macro to determine whether the given WT_REF has a page with

 *
 * The reconciliation code is used in the following situations:
 *
 * (1) by the eviction server during sync;
 * (2) by the eviction server during forced eviction of a page; and
 * (3) by any thread during LRU eviction.
 *
 * The complexity is checking the page state of child pages when looking for
 * pages to merge.
 *
 * We clearly want to consider all normal, in-memory pages (WT_REF_MEM).
 *
 * While we are processing a sync request in case (1), pages in the file may be
 * awaiting forced eviction (WT_REF_EVICT_FORCE).  Those pages must be included
 * in the sync, otherwise it will be incomplete.
 *
 * During LRU eviction in case (3), the eviction code has already locked the
 * subtree, so locked pages should be included in the merge (WT_REF_LOCKED).
 *
 * To make this tractable, the eviction server guarantees that no thread is
 * doing LRU eviction in the tree when cases (1) and (2) occur.  That is, the
 * only state change that can occur during a sync or forced eviction is for a
 * reference to a page on disk to cause a page to be read (WT_REF_READING).  We
 * can safely ignore those pages because they are unmodified by definition --
 * they are being read from disk.
 *
 * If there is a valid page associated with the reference, a pointer to the
 * page is assigned to the second parameter.  The macro evaluates true if the
