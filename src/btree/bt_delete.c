/*
 * Fast-delete support.
 *
 * This file contains most of the code that allows WiredTiger to delete pages
 * of data without reading them into the cache.  (This feature is currently
 * only available for row-store objects.)
 *
 * The way cursor truncate works in a row-store object is it explicitly reads
 * the first and last pages of the truncate range, then walks the tree with a
 * flag so the tree walk code skips reading eligible pages within the range
 * and instead just marks them as deleted, by changing their WT_REF state to
 * WT_REF_DELETED. Pages ineligible for this fast path include pages already
 * in the cache, having overflow items, or requiring lookaside records.
 * Ineligible pages are read and have their rows updated/deleted individually.
 * The transaction for the delete operation is stored in memory referenced by
 * the WT_REF.page_del field.
 *
 * Future cursor walks of the tree will skip the deleted page based on the
 * transaction stored for the delete, but it gets more complicated if a read is
 * done using a random key, or a cursor walk is done with a transaction where
 * the delete is not visible.  In those cases, we read the original contents of
 * the page.  The page-read code notices a deleted page is being read, and as
 * part of the read instantiates the contents of the page, creating a WT_UPDATE
 * with a deleted operation, in the same transaction as deleted the page.  In
 * other words, the read process makes it appear as if the page was read and
 * each individual row deleted, exactly as would have happened if the page had
 * been in the cache all along.
 *
 * There's an additional complication to support rollback of the page delete.
 * When the page was marked deleted, a pointer to the WT_REF was saved in the
 * deleting session's transaction list and the delete is unrolled by resetting
 * the WT_REF_DELETED state back to WT_REF_DISK.  However, if the page has been
 * instantiated by some reading thread, that's not enough, each individual row
 * on the page must have the delete operation reset.  If the page split, the
 * WT_UPDATE lists might have been saved/restored during reconciliation and
 * appear on multiple pages, and the WT_REF stored in the deleting session's
 * transaction list is no longer useful.  For this reason, when the page is
 * instantiated by a read, a list of the WT_UPDATE structures on the page is
 * stored in the WT_REF.page_del field, with the transaction ID, that way the
 * session committing/unrolling the delete can find all WT_UPDATE structures
 * that require update.
 *
 * One final note: pages can also be marked deleted if emptied and evicted.  In
 * that case, the WT_REF state will be set to WT_REF_DELETED but there will not
 * be any associated WT_REF.page_del field.  These pages are always skipped
 * during cursor traversal (the page could not have been evicted if there were
 * updates that weren't globally visible), and if read is forced to instantiate
 * such a page, it simply creates an empty page from scratch.
