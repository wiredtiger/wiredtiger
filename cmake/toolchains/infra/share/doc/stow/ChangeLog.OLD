Sat Jan 26 16:15:21 2002  Guillaume Morin  <gmorin@gnu.org>

    * stow.in: if $ENV{'STOW_DIR'} is set, this becomes the default
      Stow directory.

    * Makefile.am: use EXTRA_DIST to include manpage in distribution

Wed Jan 02 21:33:41 2002  Guillaume Morin  <gmorin@gnu.org>

    * stow.in: Stow now only warns the user if a subdirectory
      is unreadable during unstowing.

Wed Jan 02 20:58:05 2002  Guillaume Morin  <gmorin@gnu.org>

    * stow.in: fixed JoinPaths so that subdirs called "0" are
      correctly pushed. Thanks a lot to Gergely Nagy
      <algernon@bonehunter.rulez.org> who patiently helped me to chase 
      this bug.

Sun Dec 30 21:58:25 2001  Guillaume Morin  <gmorin@gnu.org>

    * stow.in: fixed a bug introduced by previous changes when
      Target argument was relative. (thanks to Luca Filipozzi
      <lfilipoz@debian.org> for pointing this out)
	   
Sun Dec 30 18:23:25 2001  Guillaume Morin  <gmorin@gnu.org>

    * stow.in: now requires Perl 5. Use POSIX getcwd instead of broken
      fastcwd. Fixed bug when CommonParent is /. Stow does not remove
      initially empty directories anymore.
	
Sun Dec 30 18:07:51 2001  Guillaume Morin  <gmorin@gnu.org>

    * configure.in: automake fixes (fp_ -> AC, +AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE)

Fri Oct 11 22:09:45 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* stow.html, configure.in: Version 1.3.2.

	* README, stow.texi: Correct the URL again.

Fri Oct 11 18:20:42 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* configure.in: Version 1.3.1.

	* stow.html: Update Stow manual URL.  Mention version 1.3.1.

	* README: Update Stow URL.

	* Makefile.am: stow-manual.html -> manual.html.

	* stow.texi:
	Add a reference to the Stow home page on the GNU web server.  Change
	several occurrences of "which" to "that" for grammatical superiority.

Wed Oct  9 00:34:07 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	Add maintainer-only rules for stow-manual.html and stow-manual.texi.

Wed Oct  9 00:32:31 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* README: Refer to the new location for the Stow home page.

	* stow.html: Make it right for the GNU web server.

Tue Oct  8 21:54:09 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* stow.texi: Document --restow

	* stow.in: Add --restow (-R) option

	* configure.in: Add "perl4" to search for Perl binary.
	Bump version number to 1.3.

Mon Jun 24 23:23:03 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* stow.texi: Delete trailing whitespace.

Fri Jun 21 19:44:26 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* Makefile.am:
	Don't explicitly mention version.texi.  Automake now does it
 	automagically, by noticing the `@include version.texi' in
 	stow.texi.  Awesome.

	* stow.texi:
	Use @include instead of @input.  This is more Texinfoid, plus
	allows Automake to automatically deduce the need for
	version.texi.

	* stow.in:
	Elide trailing slashes from package names, then complain if
	package names have slashes in them.

Tue Jun 18 23:19:04 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* README: Call it "Gnu Stow".

Tue Jun 18 22:15:45 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* configure.in:
	Bump version number to 1.2.

	Look for Perl under the names `perl' and `perl5'.  If not found,
	print a warning.

	* stow.texi:
	Add a section about bootstrapping.  Add text about hacking Gnu
	Make output.

	* INSTALL:
	Describe what happens when Perl isn't found during `configure'.

Mon Jun 17 19:43:25 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* THANKS: Thank Fritz.

Fri Jun 14 19:18:50 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

	* AUTHORS: Credit John Bazik and Gord Matzigkeit.

	* stow.texi: Remove a "known bug" -- the pwd dependency is gone.

	* stow.in:
	Use fastcwd, from fastcwd.pl (which is GPL'd), to remove
 	dependency on an external pwd binary.  Suggested by Gord
	Matzigkeit.

	* stow.in: Add a missing comma.

Thu Jun 13 21:52:10 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>

 	directly into a make target.

	* TODO: New file.

	* stow.in:

 	`version' and `help' options.  Refer to "packages," not
 	"collections," for consistency with the manual.

	* stow.texi:
	Refer to "Gnu Stow" in a few places.  Use <bobg+stow@zanshin.com>
 	as the contact address.  Add sections on Reporting bugs and Known
 	bugs.  Create a master menu.  Minor rewording.  Remove the period
 	from a node name.

	* TODO, THANKS: New files.

Mon Jun 10 14:44:13 1996  Bob Glickstein  <bobg@hiro.zanshin.com>
