<h2 class="chapter">12 Compile-time vs Install-time</h2>

<p>Software whose installation is managed with Stow needs to be installed
in one place (the package directory, e.g. <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/stow/perl</span></samp>)
but needs to appear to run in another place (the target tree, e.g.,
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>).  Why is this important?  What's wrong with Perl, for
instance, looking for its files in <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/stow/perl</span></samp> instead
of in <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>?

   <p>The answer is that there may be another package, e.g.,
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/stow/perl-extras</span></samp>, stowed under <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>.  If
Perl is configured to find its files in <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/stow/perl</span></samp>, it
will never find the extra files in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">perl-extras</span></samp>&rsquo; package, even
though they're intended to be found by Perl.  On the other hand, if Perl
looks for its files in <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>, then it will find the
intermingled Perl and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">perl-extras</span></samp>&rsquo; files.

   <p>This means that when you compile a package, you must tell it the
location of the run-time, or target tree; but when you install it, you
must place it in the stow tree.

<h3 class="section">12.1 Advice on changing compilation and installation parameters</h3>

<p>Some software packages allow you to specify, at compile-time, separate
locations for installation and for run-time.  Perl is one such package;
see <a href="Perl-and-Perl-5-Modules.html#Perl-and-Perl-5-Modules">Perl and Perl 5 Modules</a>.  Others allow you to compile the
package, then give a different destination in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo;
step without causing the binaries or other files to get rebuilt.  Most
GNU software falls into this category; Emacs is a notable exception. 
See <a href="GNU-Emacs.html#GNU-Emacs">GNU Emacs</a>, and <a href="Other-FSF-Software.html#Other-FSF-Software">Other FSF Software</a>.

   <p>Still other software packages cannot abide the idea of separate
installation and run-time locations at all.  If you try to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make
install prefix=/usr/local/stow/</span><var>foo</var></samp>&rsquo;, then first the whole package
will be recompiled to hardwire the <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/stow/</span><var>foo</var></samp>
path.  With these packages, it is best to compile normally, then run
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make -n install</span></samp>&rsquo;, which should report all the steps needed to
install the just-built software.  Place this output into a file, edit
the commands in the file to remove recompilation steps and to reflect
the Stow-based installation location, and execute the edited file as a
shell script in place of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Be sure to execute the
script using the same shell that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; would have used.

   <p>(If you use GNU Make and a shell [such as GNU bash] that understands
<samp><span class="command">pushd</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">popd</span></samp>, you can do the following:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Replace all lines matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make[</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">]: Entering directory
</span><var>dir</var></samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pushd </span><var>dir</var></samp>&rsquo;. 
<li>Replace all lines matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make[</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">]: Leaving directory
</span><var>dir</var></samp>&rsquo; with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">popd</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<li>Delete all lines matching &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make[</span><var>n</var><span class="samp">]: Nothing to be done for
</span><var>rule</var></samp>&rsquo;.
        </ol>

   <p>Then find other lines in the output containing <samp><span class="command">cd</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>
commands and rewrite or delete them.  In particular, you should be able
to delete sections of the script that resemble this:

<pre class="example">     for i in <var>dir_1</var> <var>dir_2</var> <span class="roman">...</span>; do \
       (cd $i; make <var>args</var> <span class="roman">...</span>) \
     done
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note, that's &ldquo;should be able to,&rdquo; not &ldquo;can.&rdquo;  Be sure to modulate
these guidelines with plenty of your own intelligence.

   <p>The details of stowing some specific packages are described in the
following sections.
