<h2 class="chapter">6 Deleting Packages</h2>

<p><a name="index-deletion-28"></a>When the <samp><span class="option">-D</span></samp> option is given, the action of Stow is to
delete a package from the target tree.  Note that Stow will not
delete anything it doesn't &ldquo;own&rdquo;.  Deleting a package does <em>not</em>
mean removing it from the stow directory or discarding the package
tree.

   <p>To delete a package, Stow recursively scans the target tree, skipping over any
directory that is not included in the installation image.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
For example, if the target directory is <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> and the
installation image for the package being deleted has only a <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp>
directory and a <samp><span class="file">man</span></samp> directory at the top level, then we only scan
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin</span></samp> and  <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/man</span></samp>, and not
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share</span></samp>, or for that matter
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/stow</span></samp>.  Any symlink it finds that points into the package
being deleted is removed.  Any directory that contained only symlinks to the
package being deleted is removed.

   <p><a name="tree-refolding"></a>

<h3 class="section">6.1 Refolding &ldquo;foldable&rdquo; trees.</h3>

<p><a name="index-refolding-trees-29"></a><a name="index-tree-refolding-30"></a>
After removing symlinks and empty subdirectories, any directory that
contains only symlinks to a single other package is considered to be a
previously &ldquo;folded&rdquo; tree that was &ldquo;split open.&rdquo;  Stow will refold
the tree by removing the symlinks to the surviving package, removing
the directory, then linking the directory back to the surviving
package.  However, this behaviour can be prevented via the
<samp><span class="option">--no-folding</span></samp> option; see <a href="Invoking-Stow.html#Invoking-Stow">Invoking Stow</a>.

   <div class="footnote">

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> This
approach was introduced in version 2 of GNU Stow.  Previously, the whole
target tree was scanned and stow directories were explicitly omitted.  This
became problematic when dealing with very large installations.  The only
situation where this is useful is if you accidentally delete a directory in
the package tree, leaving you with a whole bunch of dangling links.  Note that
you can enable the old approach with the <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option.  Alternatively, you can
use the <samp><span class="option">--badlinks</span></samp> option get stow to search for dangling links in your target tree and remove the offenders manually.</p>
